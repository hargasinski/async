"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Modules async Async.js For Async v1.5.x documentation, go HERE Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for use with Node.js and installable via npm install --save async, it can also be used directly in the browser. Async is also installable via: bower: bower install async component: component install caolan/async jam: jam install async Async provides around 70 functions that include the usual 'functional' suspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns for asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these functions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single callback as the last argument of your asynchronous function -- a callback which expects an Error as its first argument -- and calling the callback once. Quick Examplesasync.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){ // results is now an array of stats for each file }); async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) { fs.access(filePath, function(err) { callback(null, !err) }); }, function(err, results){ // results now equals an array of the existing files }); async.parallel([ function(callback){ ... }, function(callback){ ... } ], function(err, results) { // optional callback }; async.series([ function(callback){ ... }, function(callback){ ... } ]);There are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a full list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is missing please create a GitHub issue for it. Common Pitfalls (StackOverflow)Synchronous iteration functionsIf you get an error like RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded. or other stack overflow issues when using async, you are likely using a synchronous iteratee. By synchronous we mean a function that calls its callback on the same tick in the javascript event loop, without doing any I/O or using any timers. Calling many callbacks iteratively will quickly overflow the stack. If you run into this issue, just defer your callback with async.setImmediate to start a new call stack on the next tick of the event loop. This can also arise by accident if you callback early in certain cases: async.eachSeries(hugeArray, function iteratee(item, callback) { if (inCache(item)) { callback(null, cache[item]); // if many items are cached, you'll overflow } else { doSomeIO(item, callback); } }, function done() { //... });Just change it to: async.eachSeries(hugeArray, function iteratee(item, callback) { if (inCache(item)) { async.setImmediate(function () { callback(null, cache[item]); }); } else { doSomeIO(item, callback); //... } });Async does not guard against synchronous iteratees for performance reasons. If you are still running into stack overflows, you can defer as suggested above, or wrap functions with async.ensureAsync Functions that are asynchronous by their nature do not have this problem and don't need the extra callback deferral. If JavaScript's event loop is still a bit nebulous, check out this article or this talk for more detailed information about how it works. Multiple callbacksMake sure to always return when calling a callback early, otherwise you will cause multiple callbacks and unpredictable behavior in many cases. async.waterfall([ function (callback) { getSomething(options, function (err, result) { if (err) { callback(new Error(&quot;failed getting something:&quot; + err.message)); // we should return here } // since we did not return, this callback still will be called and // `processData` will be called twice callback(null, result); }); }, processData ], done)It is always good practice to return callback(err, result) whenever a callback call is not the last statement of a function. Binding a context to an iterateeThis section is really about bind, not about async. If you are wondering how to make async execute your iteratees in a given context, or are confused as to why a method of another library isn't working as an iteratee, study this example: // Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method var AsyncSquaringLibrary = { squareExponent: 2, square: function(number, callback){ var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent); setTimeout(function(){ callback(null, result); }, 200); } }; async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){ // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN] // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is // therefore undefined. }); async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){ // result is [1, 4, 9] // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iteratee before // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its // 'home' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent` // will be as expected. });DownloadThe source is available for download from GitHub. Alternatively, you can install using npm: npm install --save asyncAs well as using Bower: bower install asyncYou can then require() async as normal: var async = require(&quot;async&quot;);Or require individual methods: var waterfall = require(&quot;async/waterfall&quot;); var map = require(&quot;async/map&quot;);Development: async.js - 29.6kb Uncompressed In the BrowserAsync should work in any ES5 environment (IE9 and above). Usage: &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;async.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){ alert(results); }); &lt;/script&gt;ES ModulesWe also provide async as a collection of ES2015 modules, in an alternative async-es package on npm. npm i -S async-esimport waterfall from 'async-es/waterfall'; import async from 'async-es'; × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 on 2016-06-20T05:11:38-04:00 using the DocStrap template.

Although originally designed for use with Node.js and installable via npm install --save async, it can also be used directly in the browser. Methods &lt;static&gt; apply(function) Creates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. Useful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments passed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed to apply. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description function function The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to. Invokes with (arguments...). arguments... * &lt;repeatable&gt; Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the continuation is called. Example // using apply async.parallel([ async.apply(fs.writeFile, 'testfile1', 'test1'), async.apply(fs.writeFile, 'testfile2', 'test2') ]); // the same process without using apply async.parallel([ function(callback) { fs.writeFile('testfile1', 'test1', callback); }, function(callback) { fs.writeFile('testfile2', 'test2', callback); } ]); // It's possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the // continuation: node&gt; var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, 'one'); node&gt; fn('two', 'three'); one two three &lt;static&gt; applyEach(fns [, args] [, callback]) Applies the provided arguments to each function in the array, calling callback after all functions have completed. If you only provide the first argument, then it will return a function which lets you pass in the arguments as if it were a single function call. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fns Array | Object A collection of asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments args * &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; any number of separate arguments to pass to the function. callback function &lt;optional&gt; the final argument should be the callback, called when all functions have completed processing. Returns: If only the first argument is provided, it will return a function which lets you pass in the arguments as if it were a single function call. Type function Example async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema], 'bucket', callback); // partial application example: async.each( buckets, async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema]), callback ); &lt;static&gt; applyEachSeries(fns [, args] [, callback]) The same as applyEach but runs only a single async operation at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fns Array | Object A collection of asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments args * &lt;optional&gt; &lt;repeatable&gt; any number of separate arguments to pass to the function. callback function &lt;optional&gt; the final argument should be the callback, called when all functions have completed processing. See: async.applyEach Returns: If only the first argument is provided, it will return a function which lets you pass in the arguments as if it were a single function call. Type function &lt;static&gt; asyncify(func) Take a sync function and make it async, passing its return value to a callback. This is useful for plugging sync functions into a waterfall, series, or other async functions. Any arguments passed to the generated function will be passed to the wrapped function (except for the final callback argument). Errors thrown will be passed to the callback. If the function passed to asyncify returns a Promise, that promises's resolved/rejected state will be used to call the callback, rather than simply the synchronous return value. This also means you can asyncify ES2016 async functions. Parameters: Name Type Description func function The synchronous function to convert to an asynchronous function. Returns: An asynchronous wrapper of the func. To be invoked with (callback). Type function Example // passing a regular synchronous function async.waterfall([ async.apply(fs.readFile, filename, &quot;utf8&quot;), async.asyncify(JSON.parse), function (data, next) { // data is the result of parsing the text. // If there was a parsing error, it would have been caught. } ], callback); // passing a function returning a promise async.waterfall([ async.apply(fs.readFile, filename, &quot;utf8&quot;), async.asyncify(function (contents) { return db.model.create(contents); }), function (model, next) { // `model` is the instantiated model object. // If there was an error, this function would be skipped. } ], callback); // es6 example var q = async.queue(async.asyncify(async function(file) { var intermediateStep = await processFile(file); return await somePromise(intermediateStep) })); q.push(files); &lt;static&gt; auto(tasks [, concurrency] [, callback]) Determines the best order for running the functions in tasks, based on their requirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed first, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. If any of the functions pass an error to their callback, the auto sequence will stop. Further tasks will not execute (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main callback is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an object containing the results of functions which have completed so far as the first argument, if they have dependencies. If a task function has no dependencies, it will only be passed a callback. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description tasks Object An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object's key of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks. The function receives one or two arguments: a results object, containing the results of the previously executed functions, only passed if the task has any dependencies, a callback(err, result) function, which must be called when finished, passing an error (which can be null) and the result of the function's execution. concurrency number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An optional integer for determining the maximum number of tasks that can be run in parallel. By default, as many as possible. callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback which is called when all the tasks have been completed. It receives the err argument if any tasks pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if an error occurs, no further tasks will be performed, and the results object will only contain partial results. Invoked with (err, results). Returns: undefined Example async.auto({ // this function will just be passed a callback readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, 'data.txt', 'utf-8'), showData: ['readData', function(results, cb) { // results.readData is the file's contents // ... }] }, callback); async.auto({ get_data: function(callback) { console.log('in get_data'); // async code to get some data callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array'); }, make_folder: function(callback) { console.log('in make_folder'); // async code to create a directory to store a file in // this is run at the same time as getting the data callback(null, 'folder'); }, write_file: ['get_data', 'make_folder', function(results, callback) { console.log('in write_file', JSON.stringify(results)); // once there is some data and the directory exists, // write the data to a file in the directory callback(null, 'filename'); }], email_link: ['write_file', function(results, callback) { console.log('in email_link', JSON.stringify(results)); // once the file is written let's email a link to it... // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file. callback(null, {'file':results.write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'}); }] }, function(err, results) { console.log('err = ', err); console.log('results = ', results); }); &lt;static&gt; autoInject(tasks [, callback]) A dependency-injected version of the async.auto function. Dependent tasks are specified as parameters to the function, after the usual callback parameter, with the parameter names matching the names of the tasks it depends on. This can provide even more readable task graphs which can be easier to maintain. If a final callback is specified, the task results are similarly injected, specified as named parameters after the initial error parameter. The autoInject function is purely syntactic sugar and its semantics are otherwise equivalent to async.auto. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tasks Object An object, each of whose properties is a function of the form 'func([dependencies...], callback). The object's key of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks. The callback parameter is a callback(err, result) which must be called when finished, passing an error (which can be null) and the result of the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the arguments of those parameters. callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback which is called when all the tasks have been completed. It receives the err argument if any tasks pass an error to their callback. The remaining parameters are task names whose results you are interested in. This callback will only be called when all tasks have finished or an error has occurred, and so do not specify dependencies in the same way as tasks do. If an error occurs, no further tasks will be performed, and results will only be valid for those tasks which managed to complete. Invoked with (err, [results...]). See: async.auto Example // The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows: async.autoInject({ get_data: function(callback) { // async code to get some data callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array'); }, make_folder: function(callback) { // async code to create a directory to store a file in // this is run at the same time as getting the data callback(null, 'folder'); }, write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) { // once there is some data and the directory exists, // write the data to a file in the directory callback(null, 'filename'); }, email_link: function(write_file, callback) { // once the file is written let's email a link to it... // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file. callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'}); } }, function(err, email_link) { console.log('err = ', err); console.log('email_link = ', email_link); }); // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject` // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be // collapsed to a single letter identifier. To work around this, you can // explicitly specify the names of the parameters your task function needs // in an array, similar to Angular.js dependency injection. The final // results callback can be provided as an array in the same way. // This still has an advantage over plain `auto`, since the results a task // depends on are still spread into arguments. async.autoInject({ //... write_file: ['get_data', 'make_folder', function(get_data, make_folder, callback) { callback(null, 'filename'); }], email_link: ['write_file', function(write_file, callback) { callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'}); }] //... }, ['email_link', function(err, email_link) { console.log('err = ', err); console.log('email_link = ', email_link); }]); &lt;static&gt; cargo(worker [, payload]) Creates a cargo object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the cargo will be processed altogether (up to the payload limit). If the worker is in progress, the task is queued until it becomes available. Once the worker has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called. Check out these animations for how cargo and queue work. While queue passes only one task to one of a group of workers at a time, cargo passes an array of tasks to a single worker, repeating when the worker is finished. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description worker function An asynchronous function for processing an array of queued tasks, which must call its callback(err) argument when finished, with an optional err argument. Invoked with (tasks, callback). payload number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An optional integer for determining how many tasks should be processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited. See: async.queue Returns: A cargo object to manage the tasks. Callbacks can attached as certain properties to listen for specific events during the lifecycle of the cargo and inner queue. Type CargoObject Example // create a cargo object with payload 2 var cargo = async.cargo(function(tasks, callback) { for (var i=0; i&lt;tasks.length; i++) { console.log('hello ' + tasks[i].name); } callback(); }, 2); // add some items cargo.push({name: 'foo'}, function(err) { console.log('finished processing foo'); }); cargo.push({name: 'bar'}, function(err) { console.log('finished processing bar'); }); cargo.push({name: 'baz'}, function(err) { console.log('finished processing baz'); }); &lt;static&gt; compose(functions) Creates a function which is a composition of the passed asynchronous functions. Each function consumes the return value of the function that follows. Composing functions f(), g(), and h() would produce the result of f(g(h())), only this version uses callbacks to obtain the return values. Each function is executed with the this binding of the composed function. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description functions function &lt;repeatable&gt; the asynchronous functions to compose Returns: an asynchronous function that is the composed asynchronous functions Type function Example function add1(n, callback) { setTimeout(function () { callback(null, n + 1); }, 10); } function mul3(n, callback) { setTimeout(function () { callback(null, n * 3); }, 10); } var add1mul3 = async.compose(mul3, add1); add1mul3(4, function (err, result) { // result now equals 15 }); &lt;static&gt; concat(coll, iteratee [, callback(err)]) Applies iteratee to each item in coll, concatenating the results. Returns the concatenated list. The iteratees are called in parallel, and the results are concatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will be returned in the original order of coll passed to the iteratee function. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, results) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and an array of results. Invoked with (item, callback). callback(err) function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array containing the concatenated results of the iteratee function. Invoked with (err, results). Example async.concat(['dir1','dir2','dir3'], fs.readdir, function(err, files) { // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories }); &lt;static&gt; concatSeries(coll, iteratee [, callback(err)]) The same as concat but runs only a single async operation at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, results) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and an array of results. Invoked with (item, callback). callback(err) function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array containing the concatenated results of the iteratee function. Invoked with (err, results). See: async.concat &lt;static&gt; constant() Returns a function that when called, calls-back with the values provided. Useful as the first function in a waterfall, or for plugging values in to auto. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description arguments... * &lt;repeatable&gt; Any number of arguments to automatically invoke callback with. Returns: Returns a function that when invoked, automatically invokes the callback with the previous given arguments. Type function Example async.waterfall([ async.constant(42), function (value, next) { // value === 42 }, //... ], callback); async.waterfall([ async.constant(filename, &quot;utf8&quot;), fs.readFile, function (fileData, next) { //... } //... ], callback); async.auto({ hostname: async.constant(&quot;https://server.net/&quot;), port: findFreePort, launchServer: [&quot;hostname&quot;, &quot;port&quot;, function (options, cb) { startServer(options, cb); }], //... }, callback); &lt;static&gt; detect(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Returns the first value in coll that passes an async truth test. The iteratee is applied in parallel, meaning the first iteratee to return true will fire the detect callback with that result. That means the result might not be the first item in the original coll (in terms of order) that passes the test. If order within the original coll is important, then look at detectSeries. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called as soon as any iteratee returns true, or after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iteratee) or the value undefined if none passed. Invoked with (err, result). Example async.detect(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) { fs.access(filePath, function(err) { callback(null, !err) }); }, function(err, result) { // result now equals the first file in the list that exists }); &lt;static&gt; detectLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as detect but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called as soon as any iteratee returns true, or after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iteratee) or the value undefined if none passed. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.detect &lt;static&gt; detectSeries(coll, iteratee [, callback]) The same as detect but runs only a single async operation at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called as soon as any iteratee returns true, or after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iteratee) or the value undefined if none passed. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.detect &lt;static&gt; doDuring(fn, test [, callback]) The post-check version of async.during. To reflect the difference in the order of operations, the arguments test and fn are switched. Also a version of async.doWhilst with asynchronous test function. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fn function A function which is called each time test passes. The function is passed a callback(err), which must be called once it has completed with an optional err argument. Invoked with (callback). test function asynchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn. Invoked with (callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after the test function has failed and repeated execution of fn has stopped. callback will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final fn's callback. Invoked with (err, [results]); See: async.during &lt;static&gt; doUntil(fn, test [, callback]) Like async.doWhilst, except the test is inverted. Note the argument ordering differs from until. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fn function A function which is called each time test fails. The function is passed a callback(err), which must be called once it has completed with an optional err argument. Invoked with (callback). test function synchronous truth test to perform after each execution of fn. Invoked with the non-error callback results of fn. callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after the test function has passed and repeated execution of fn has stopped. callback will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final fn's callback. Invoked with (err, [results]); See: async.doWhilst &lt;static&gt; doWhilst(fn, test [, callback]) The post-check version of async.whilst. To reflect the difference in the order of operations, the arguments test and fn are switched. doWhilst is to whilst as do while is to while in plain JavaScript. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fn function A function which is called each time test passes. The function is passed a callback(err), which must be called once it has completed with an optional err argument. Invoked with (callback). test function synchronous truth test to perform after each execution of fn. Invoked with Invoked with the non-error callback results of fn. callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after the test function has failed and repeated execution of fn has stopped. callback will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final fn's callback. Invoked with (err, [results]); See: async.whilst &lt;static&gt; during(test, fn [, callback]) Like async.whilst, except the test is an asynchronous function that is passed a callback in the form of function (err, truth). If error is passed to test or fn, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description test function asynchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn. Invoked with (callback). fn function A function which is called each time test passes. The function is passed a callback(err), which must be called once it has completed with an optional err argument. Invoked with (callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after the test function has failed and repeated execution of fn has stopped. callback will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final fn's callback. Invoked with (err, [results]); See: async.whilst Example var count = 0; async.during( function (callback) { return callback(null, count &lt; 5); }, function (callback) { count++; setTimeout(callback, 1000); }, function (err) { // 5 seconds have passed } ); &lt;static&gt; each(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Applies the function iteratee to each item in coll, in parallel. The iteratee is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it has finished. If the iteratee passes an error to its callback, the main callback (for the each function) is immediately called with the error. Note, that since this function applies iteratee to each item in parallel, there is no guarantee that the iteratee functions will complete in order. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has completed. If no error has occurred, the callback should be run without arguments or with an explicit null argument. The array index is not passed to the iteratee. Invoked with (item, callback). If you need the index, use eachOf. callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Invoked with (err). Example // assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function // to save the modified contents of that file: async.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){ // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error }); // assuming openFiles is an array of file names async.each(openFiles, function(file, callback) { // Perform operation on file here. console.log('Processing file ' + file); if( file.length &gt; 32 ) { console.log('This file name is too long'); callback('File name too long'); } else { // Do work to process file here console.log('File processed'); callback(); } }, function(err) { // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error if( err ) { // One of the iterations produced an error. // All processing will now stop. console.log('A file failed to process'); } else { console.log('All files have been processed successfully'); } }); &lt;static&gt; eachLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as each but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A colleciton to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has completed. If no error has occurred, the callback should be run without arguments or with an explicit null argument. The array index is not passed to the iteratee. Invoked with (item, callback). If you need the index, use eachOfLimit. callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Invoked with (err). See: async.each &lt;static&gt; eachOf(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Like each, except that it passes the key (or index) as the second argument to the iteratee. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The key is the item's key, or index in the case of an array. The iteratee is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has completed. If no error has occurred, the callback should be run without arguments or with an explicit null argument. Invoked with (item, key, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Invoked with (err). Example var obj = {dev: &quot;/dev.json&quot;, test: &quot;/test.json&quot;, prod: &quot;/prod.json&quot;}; var configs = {}; async.forEachOf(obj, function (value, key, callback) { fs.readFile(__dirname + value, &quot;utf8&quot;, function (err, data) { if (err) return callback(err); try { configs[key] = JSON.parse(data); } catch (e) { return callback(e); } callback(); }); }, function (err) { if (err) console.error(err.message); // configs is now a map of JSON data doSomethingWith(configs); }); &lt;static&gt; eachOfLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as eachOf but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The key is the item's key, or index in the case of an array. The iteratee is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has completed.

See: async.each &lt;static&gt; ensureAsync(fn) Wrap an async function and ensure it calls its callback on a later tick of the event loop. If the function already calls its callback on a next tick, no extra deferral is added. This is useful for preventing stack overflows (RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded) and generally keeping Zalgo contained. Parameters: Name Type Description fn function an async function, one that expects a node-style callback as its last argument. Returns: Returns a wrapped function with the exact same call signature as the function passed in. Type function Example function sometimesAsync(arg, callback) { if (cache[arg]) { return callback(null, cache[arg]); // this would be synchronous!! } else { doSomeIO(arg, callback); // this IO would be asynchronous } } // this has a risk of stack overflows if many results are cached in a row async.mapSeries(args, sometimesAsync, done); // this will defer sometimesAsync's callback if necessary, // preventing stack overflows async.mapSeries(args, async.ensureAsync(sometimesAsync), done); &lt;static&gt; every(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Returns true if every element in coll satisfies an async test. If any iteratee call returns false, the main callback is immediately called. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in the collection in parallel. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on the values of the async tests. Invoked with (err, result). Example async.every(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) { fs.access(filePath, function(err) { callback(null, !err) }); }, function(err, result) { // if result is true then every file exists }); &lt;static&gt; everyLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as every but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time.

Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in the collection in parallel. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on the values of the async tests. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.every &lt;static&gt; filter(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Returns a new array of all the values in coll which pass an async truth test. This operation is performed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the original. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue), which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Invoked with (err, results). Example async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) { fs.access(filePath, function(err) { callback(null, !err) }); }, function(err, results) { // results now equals an array of the existing files }); &lt;static&gt; filterLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as filter but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue), which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed.

The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue), which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Invoked with (err, results) See: async.filter &lt;static&gt; forever(fn [, errback]) Calls the asynchronous function fn with a callback parameter that allows it to call itself again, in series, indefinitely. If an error is passed to the callback then errback is called with the error, and execution stops, otherwise it will never be called. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description fn function a function to call repeatedly. Invoked with (next). errback function &lt;optional&gt; when fn passes an error to it's callback, this function will be called, and execution stops. Invoked with (err). Example async.forever( function(next) { // next is suitable for passing to things that need a callback(err [, whatever]); // it will result in this function being called again. }, function(err) { // if next is called with a value in its first parameter, it will appear // in here as 'err', and execution will stop. } ); &lt;static&gt; iterator(tasks) Creates an iterator function which calls the next function in the tasks array, returning a continuation to call the next one after that. It's also possible to “peek” at the next iterator with iterator.next(). This function is used internally by the async module, but can be useful when you want to manually control the flow of functions in series. Parameters: Name Type Description tasks Array An array of functions to run. Returns: The next function to run in the series. Example var iterator = async.iterator([ function() { sys.p('one'); }, function() { sys.p('two'); }, function() { sys.p('three'); } ]); node&gt; var iterator2 = iterator(); 'one' node&gt; var iterator3 = iterator2(); 'two' node&gt; iterator3(); 'three' node&gt; var nextfn = iterator2.next(); node&gt; nextfn(); 'three' &lt;static&gt; log(function) Logs the result of an async function to the console using console.dir to display the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or in browsers that support console.dir and console.error (such as FF and Chrome). If multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.dir is called on each argument in order. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description function function The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to. arguments... * &lt;repeatable&gt; Any number of arguments to apply to the function. Example // in a module var hello = function(name, callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, {hello: name}); }, 1000); }; // in the node repl node&gt; async.dir(hello, 'world'); {hello: 'world'} &lt;static&gt; log(function) Logs the result of an async function to the console. Only works in Node.js or in browsers that support console.log and console.error (such as FF and Chrome). If multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.log is called on each argument in order. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description function function The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to. arguments... * &lt;repeatable&gt; Any number of arguments to apply to the function. Example // in a module var hello = function(name, callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'hello ' + name); }, 1000); }; // in the node repl node&gt; async.log(hello, 'world'); 'hello world' &lt;static&gt; map(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Produces a new collection of values by mapping each value in coll through the iteratee function. The iteratee is called with an item from coll and a callback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: an error, and the transformed item from coll. If iteratee passes an error to its callback, the main callback (for the map function) is immediately called with the error. Note, that since this function applies the iteratee to each item in parallel, there is no guarantee that the iteratee functions will complete in order. However, the results array will be in the same order as the original coll. If map is passed an Object, the results will be an Array. The results will roughly be in the order of the original Objects' keys (but this can vary across JavaScript engines) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an Array of the transformed items from the coll. Invoked with (err, results). Example async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results) { // results is now an array of stats for each file }); &lt;static&gt; mapLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as map but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the transformed items from the coll. Invoked with (err, results). See: async.map &lt;static&gt; mapSeries(coll, iteratee [, callback]) The same as map but runs only a single async operation at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the transformed items from the coll. Invoked with (err, results). See: async.map &lt;static&gt; mapValues(obj, iteratee [, callback]) A relative of map, designed for use with objects. Produces a new Object by mapping each value of obj through the iteratee function. The iteratee is called each value and key from obj and a callback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callbacks takes two arguments: an error, and the transformed item from obj. If iteratee passes an error to its callback, the main callback (for the mapValues function) is immediately called with the error. Note, the order of the keys in the result is not guaranteed. The keys will be roughly in the order they complete, (but this is very engine-specific) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description obj Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each value and key in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed value. Invoked with (value, key, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the transformed items from the obj. Invoked with (err, result). Example async.mapValues({ f1: 'file1', f2: 'file2', f3: 'file3' }, fs.stat, function(err, result) { // results is now a map of stats for each file, e.g. // { // f1: [stats for file1], // f2: [stats for file2], // f3: [stats for file3] // } }); &lt;static&gt; mapValuesLimit(obj, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as mapValues but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description obj Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A function to apply to each value in obj. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed value. Invoked with (value, key, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Result is an object of the transformed values from the obj. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.mapValues &lt;static&gt; mapValuesSeries(obj, iteratee [, callback]) The same as mapValues but runs only a single async operation at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description obj Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each value in obj. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed value. Invoked with (value, key, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called when all iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Result is an object of the transformed values from the obj. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.mapValues &lt;static&gt; memoize(fn, hasher) Caches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function results against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash function can be used. If no hash function is specified, the first argument is used as a hash key, which may work reasonably if it is a string or a data type that converts to a distinct string. Note that objects and arrays will not behave reasonably. Neither will cases where the other arguments are significant. In such cases, specify your own hash function. The cache of results is exposed as the memo property of the function returned by memoize. Parameters: Name Type Description fn function The function to proxy and cache results from. hasher function An optional function for generating a custom hash for storing results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and must be synchronous. Returns: a memoized version of fn Type function Example var slow_fn = function(name, callback) { // do something callback(null, result); }; var fn = async.memoize(slow_fn); // fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn fn('some name', function() { // callback }); &lt;static&gt; nextTick(callback) Calls callback on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just calls setImmediate. In the browser it will use setImmediate if available, otherwise setTimeout(callback, 0), which means other higher priority events may precede the execution of callback. This is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description callback function The function to call on a later loop around the event loop. Invoked with (args...). args... * &lt;repeatable&gt; any number of additional arguments to pass to the callback on the next tick. Example var call_order = []; async.nextTick(function() { call_order.push('two'); // call_order now equals ['one','two'] }); call_order.push('one'); async.setImmediate(function (a, b, c) { // a, b, and c equal 1, 2, and 3 }, 1, 2, 3); &lt;static&gt; parallel(tasks [, callback]) Run the tasks collection of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous function has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its callback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an array. Note: parallel is about kicking-off I/O tasks in parallel, not about parallel execution of code. If your tasks do not use any timers or perform any I/O, they will actually be executed in series. Any synchronous setup sections for each task will happen one after the other. JavaScript remains single-threaded. It is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be run as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object instead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from async.parallel. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tasks Array | Object A collection containing functions to run. Each function is passed a callback(err, result) which it must call on completion with an error err (which can be null) and an optional result value. callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback to run once all the functions have completed successfully. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all the result arguments passed to the task callbacks. Invoked with (err, results). Example async.parallel([ function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'one'); }, 200); }, function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'two'); }, 100); } ], // optional callback function(err, results) { // the results array will equal ['one','two'] even though // the second function had a shorter timeout. }); // an example using an object instead of an array async.parallel({ one: function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 1); }, 200); }, two: function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 2); }, 100); } }, function(err, results) { // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2} }); &lt;static&gt; parallel(tasks, limit [, callback]) The same as parallel but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tasks Array | Collection A collection containing functions to run. Each function is passed a callback(err, result) which it must call on completion with an error err (which can be null) and an optional result value. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback to run once all the functions have completed successfully. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all the result arguments passed to the task callbacks. Invoked with (err, results). See: async.parallel &lt;static&gt; priorityQueue(worker, concurrency) The same as async.queue only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. Parameters: Name Type Description worker function An asynchronous function for processing a queued task, which must call its callback(err) argument when finished, with an optional error as an argument. If you want to handle errors from an individual task, pass a callback to q.push(). Invoked with (task, callback). concurrency number An integer for determining how many worker functions should be run in parallel. If omitted, the concurrency defaults to 1. If the concurrency is 0, an error is thrown. See: async.queue Returns: A priorityQueue object to manage the tasks. There are two differences between queue and priorityQueue objects: push(task, priority, [callback]) - priority should be a number. If an array of tasks is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority. The unshift method was removed. Type queue &lt;static&gt; queue(worker [, concurrency]) Creates a queue object with the specified concurrency. Tasks added to the queue are processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit). If all workers are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. Once a worker completes a task, that task's callback is called. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description worker function An asynchronous function for processing a queued task, which must call its callback(err) argument when finished, with an optional error as an argument. If you want to handle errors from an individual task, pass a callback to q.push(). Invoked with (task, callback). concurrency number &lt;optional&gt; 1 An integer for determining how many worker functions should be run in parallel. If omitted, the concurrency defaults to 1. If the concurrency is 0, an error is thrown. Returns: A queue object to manage the tasks. Callbacks can attached as certain properties to listen for specific events during the lifecycle of the queue. Type QueueObject Example // create a queue object with concurrency 2 var q = async.queue(function(task, callback) { console.log('hello ' + task.name); callback(); }, 2); // assign a callback q.drain = function() { console.log('all items have been processed'); }; // add some items to the queue q.push({name: 'foo'}, function(err) { console.log('finished processing foo'); }); q.push({name: 'bar'}, function (err) { console.log('finished processing bar'); }); // add some items to the queue (batch-wise) q.push([{name: 'baz'},{name: 'bay'},{name: 'bax'}], function(err) { console.log('finished processing item'); }); // add some items to the front of the queue q.unshift({name: 'bar'}, function (err) { console.log('finished processing bar'); }); &lt;static&gt; race(tasks, callback) Runs the tasks array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous function has completed. Once any the tasks completed or pass an error to its callback, the main callback is immediately called. It's equivalent to Promise.race(). Parameters: Name Type Description tasks Array An array containing functions to run. Each function is passed a callback(err, result) which it must call on completion with an error err (which can be null) and an optional result value. callback function A callback to run once any of the functions have completed. This function gets an error or result from the first function that completed. Invoked with (err, result). Returns: undefined Example async.race([ function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'one'); }, 200); }, function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'two'); }, 100); } ], // main callback function(err, result) { // the result will be equal to 'two' as it finishes earlier }); &lt;static&gt; reduce(coll, memo, iteratee [, callback]) Reduces coll into a single value using an async iteratee to return each successive step. memo is the initial state of the reduction. This function only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to split a call to this function into a parallel map, and then use the normal Array.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where each step in the reduction needs to be async; if you can get the data before reducing it, then it's probably a good idea to do so. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. memo * The initial state of the reduction. iteratee function A function applied to each item in the array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, reduction) which accepts an optional error as its first argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main callback is immediately called with the error. Invoked with (memo, item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result is the reduced value. Invoked with (err, result). Example async.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback) { // pointless async: process.nextTick(function() { callback(null, memo + item) }); }, function(err, result) { // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6 }); &lt;static&gt; reduceRight(coll, memo, iteratee [, callback]) Same as reduce, only operates on coll in reverse order. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. memo * The initial state of the reduction. iteratee function A function applied to each item in the array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, reduction) which accepts an optional error as its first argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main callback is immediately called with the error. Invoked with (memo, item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result is the reduced value. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.reduce &lt;static&gt; reflect(fn) Wraps the function in another function that always returns data even when it errors. The object returned has either the property error or value. Parameters: Name Type Description fn function The function you want to wrap Returns: A function that always passes null to it's callback as the error. The second argument to the callback will be an object with either an error or a value property. Type function Example async.parallel([ async.reflect(function(callback) { // do some stuff ... callback(null, 'one'); }), async.reflect(function(callback) { // do some more stuff but error ... callback('bad stuff happened'); }), async.reflect(function(callback) { // do some more stuff ... callback(null, 'two'); }) ], // optional callback function(err, results) { // values // results[0].value = 'one' // results[1].error = 'bad stuff happened' // results[2].value = 'two' }); &lt;static&gt; reflectAll(tasks) A helper function that wraps an array of functions with reflect. Parameters: Name Type Description tasks Array The array of functions to wrap in async.reflect. See: async.reflect Returns: Returns an array of functions, each function wrapped in async.reflect Type Array Example let tasks = [ function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'one'); }, 200); }, function(callback) { // do some more stuff but error ... callback(new Error('bad stuff happened')); }, function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 'two'); }, 100); } ]; async.parallel(async.reflectAll(tasks), // optional callback function(err, results) { // values // results[0].value = 'one' // results[1].error = Error('bad stuff happened') // results[2].value = 'two' }); &lt;static&gt; reject(coll, iteratee [, callback]) The opposite of filter. Removes values that pass an async truth test. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue), which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Invoked with (err, results). See: async.filter Example async.reject(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) { fs.access(filePath, function(err) { callback(null, !err) }); }, function(err, results) { // results now equals an array of missing files createFiles(results); }); &lt;static&gt; rejectLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as reject but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue), which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed.

Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Invoked with (err, results). See: async.reject &lt;static&gt; retry( [opts], task [, callback]) Attempts to get a successful response from task no more than times times before returning an error. If the task is successful, the callback will be passed the result of the successful task. If all attempts fail, the callback will be passed the error and result (if any) of the final attempt. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description opts Object | number &lt;optional&gt; {times: 5, interval: 0}| 5 Can be either an object with times and interval or a number. times - The number of attempts to make before giving up. The default is 5. interval - The time to wait between retries, in milliseconds. The default is 0. The interval may also be specified as a function of the retry count (see example). If opts is a number, the number specifies the number of times to retry, with the default interval of 0. task function A function which receives two arguments: (1) a callback(err, result) which must be called when finished, passing err (which can be null) and the result of the function's execution, and (2) a results object, containing the results of the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow). Invoked with (callback, results). callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback which is called when the task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the err and result arguments of the last attempt at completing the task. Invoked with (err, results). Example // The `retry` function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing // a callback, as shown below: // try calling apiMethod 3 times async.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) { // do something with the result }); // try calling apiMethod 3 times, waiting 200 ms between each retry async.retry({times: 3, interval: 200}, apiMethod, function(err, result) { // do something with the result }); // try calling apiMethod 10 times with exponential backoff // (i.e. intervals of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, ... milliseconds) async.retry({ times: 10, interval: function(retryCount) { return 50 * Math.pow(2, retryCount); } }, apiMethod, function(err, result) { // do something with the result }); // try calling apiMethod the default 5 times no delay between each retry async.retry(apiMethod, function(err, result) { // do something with the result }); // It can also be embedded within other control flow functions to retry // individual methods that are not as reliable, like this: async.auto({ users: api.getUsers.bind(api), payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api)) }, function(err, results) { // do something with the results }); &lt;static&gt; retryable( [opts], task) A close relative of retry. This method wraps a task and makes it retryable, rather than immediately calling it with retries. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description opts Object | number &lt;optional&gt; {times: 5, interval: 0}| 5 optional options, exactly the same as from retry task function the asynchronous function to wrap See: async.retry Returns: The wrapped function, which when invoked, will retry on an error, based on the parameters specified in opts. Type Functions Example async.auto({ dep1: async.retryable(3, getFromFlakyService), process: [&quot;dep1&quot;, async.retryable(3, function (results, cb) { maybeProcessData(results.dep1, cb); })] }, callback); &lt;static&gt; seq(functions) Version of the compose function that is more natural to read. Each function consumes the return value of the previous function. It is the equivalent of async.compose with the arguments reversed. Each function is executed with the this binding of the composed function. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description functions function &lt;repeatable&gt; the asynchronous functions to compose See: async.compose Returns: a function that composes the functions in order Type function Example // Requires lodash (or underscore), express3 and dresende's orm2. // Part of an app, that fetches cats of the logged user. // This example uses `seq` function to avoid overnesting and error // handling clutter. app.get('/cats', function(request, response) { var User = request.models.User; async.seq( _.bind(User.get, User), // 'User.get' has signature (id, callback(err, data)) function(user, fn) { user.getCats(fn); // 'getCats' has signature (callback(err, data)) } )(req.session.user_id, function (err, cats) { if (err) { console.error(err); response.json({ status: 'error', message: err.message }); } else { response.json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Cats found', data: cats }); } }); }); &lt;static&gt; series(tasks [, callback]) Run the functions in the tasks collection in series, each one running once the previous function has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its callback, no more functions are run, and callback is immediately called with the value of the error. Otherwise, callback receives an array of results when tasks have completed. It is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be run as a function, and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object instead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from async.series. Note that while many implementations preserve the order of object properties, the ECMAScript Language Specification explicitly states that The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified. So if you rely on the order in which your series of functions are executed, and want this to work on all platforms, consider using an array. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tasks Array | Object A collection containing functions to run, each function is passed a callback(err, result) it must call on completion with an error err (which can be null) and an optional result value. callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback to run once all the functions have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all the result arguments passed to the task callbacks. Invoked with (err, result). Example async.series([ function(callback) { // do some stuff ... callback(null, 'one'); }, function(callback) { // do some more stuff ... callback(null, 'two'); } ], // optional callback function(err, results) { // results is now equal to ['one', 'two'] }); async.series({ one: function(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 1); }, 200); }, two: function(callback){ setTimeout(function() { callback(null, 2); }, 100); } }, function(err, results) { // results is now equal to: {one: 1, two: 2} }); &lt;static&gt; setImmediate(callback) Calls callback on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just calls setImmediate. In the browser it will use setImmediate if available, otherwise setTimeout(callback, 0), which means other higher priority events may precede the execution of callback. This is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description callback function The function to call on a later loop around the event loop. Invoked with (args...). args... * &lt;repeatable&gt; any number of additional arguments to pass to the callback on the next tick. Example var call_order = []; async.nextTick(function() { call_order.push('two'); // call_order now equals ['one','two'] }); call_order.push('one'); async.setImmediate(function (a, b, c) { // a, b, and c equal 1, 2, and 3 }, 1, 2, 3); &lt;static&gt; some(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Returns true if at least one element in the coll satisfies an async test. If any iteratee call returns true, the main callback is immediately called. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in the array in parallel. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called as soon as any iteratee returns true, or after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on the values of the async tests. Invoked with (err, result). Example async.some(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) { fs.access(filePath, function(err) { callback(null, !err) }); }, function(err, result) { // if result is true then at least one of the files exists }); &lt;static&gt; someLimit(coll, limit, iteratee [, callback]) The same as some but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in the array in parallel. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called as soon as any iteratee returns true, or after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on the values of the async tests. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.some &lt;static&gt; someSeries(coll, iteratee [, callback]) The same as some but runs only a single async operation at a time. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A truth test to apply to each item in the array in parallel. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, truthValue) which must be called with a boolean argument once it has completed. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called as soon as any iteratee returns true, or after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on the values of the async tests. Invoked with (err, result). See: async.some &lt;static&gt; sortBy(coll, iteratee [, callback]) Sorts a list by the results of running each coll value through an async iteratee. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. iteratee function A function to apply to each item in coll. The iteratee is passed a callback(err, sortValue) which must be called once it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a value to use as the sort criteria. Invoked with (item, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is the items from the original coll sorted by the values returned by the iteratee calls. Invoked with (err, results). Example async.sortBy(['file1','file2','file3'], function(file, callback) { fs.stat(file, function(err, stats) { callback(err, stats.mtime); }); }, function(err, results) { // results is now the original array of files sorted by // modified date }); // By modifying the callback parameter the // sorting order can be influenced: // ascending order async.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback) { callback(null, x); }, function(err,result) { // result callback }); // descending order async.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback) { callback(null, x*-1); //&lt;- x*-1 instead of x, turns the order around }, function(err,result) { // result callback }); &lt;static&gt; timeout(asyncFn, milliseconds [, info]) Sets a time limit on an asynchronous function. If the function does not call its callback within the specified milliseconds, it will be called with a timeout error. The code property for the error object will be 'ETIMEDOUT'. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description asyncFn function The asynchronous function you want to set the time limit. milliseconds number The specified time limit. info * &lt;optional&gt; Any variable you want attached (string, object, etc) to timeout Error for more information..

Type function Example async.timeout(function(callback) { doAsyncTask(callback); }, 1000); &lt;static&gt; times(n, iteratee, callback) Calls the iteratee function n times, and accumulates results in the same manner you would use with async.map. Parameters: Name Type Description n number The number of times to run the function. iteratee function The function to call n times. Invoked with the iteration index and a callback (n, next). callback function see async.map. See: async.map Example // Pretend this is some complicated async factory var createUser = function(id, callback) { callback(null, { id: 'user' + id }); }; // generate 5 users async.times(5, function(n, next) { createUser(n, function(err, user) { next(err, user); }); }, function(err, users) { // we should now have 5 users }); &lt;static&gt; timesLimit(count, limit, iteratee, callback) The same as times but runs a maximum of limit async operations at a time. Parameters: Name Type Description count number The number of times to run the function. limit number The maximum number of async operations at a time. iteratee function The function to call n times.

See: async.times &lt;static&gt; transform(coll [, accumulator], iteratee [, callback]) A relative of reduce. Takes an Object or Array, and iterates over each element in series, each step potentially mutating an accumulator value. The type of the accumulator defaults to the type of collection passed in. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description coll Array | Object A collection to iterate over. accumulator * &lt;optional&gt; The initial state of the transform. If omitted, it will default to an empty Object or Array, depending on the type of coll iteratee function A function applied to each item in the collection that potentially modifies the accumulator. The iteratee is passed a callback(err) which accepts an optional error as its first argument. If an error is passed to the callback, the transform is stopped and the main callback is immediately called with the error. Invoked with (accumulator, item, key, callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after all the iteratee functions have finished. Result is the transformed accumulator. Invoked with (err, result). Examples async.transform([1,2,3], function(acc, item, index, callback) { // pointless async: process.nextTick(function() { acc.push(item * 2) callback(null) }); }, function(err, result) { // result is now equal to [2, 4, 6] }); async.transform({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, function (obj, val, key, callback) { setImmediate(function () { obj[key] = val * 2; callback(); }) }, function (err, result) { // result is equal to {a: 2, b: 4, c: 6} }) &lt;static&gt; unmemoize(fn) Undoes a async.memoized function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized form. Handy for testing. Parameters: Name Type Description fn function the memoized function See: async.memoize Returns: a function that calls the original unmemoized function Type function &lt;static&gt; until(test, fn [, callback]) Repeatedly call fn until test returns true. Calls callback when stopped, or an error occurs. callback will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final fn's callback. The inverse of async.whilst. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description test function synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn. Invoked with (). fn function A function which is called each time test fails. The function is passed a callback(err), which must be called once it has completed with an optional err argument. Invoked with (callback). callback function &lt;optional&gt; A callback which is called after the test function has passed and repeated execution of fn has stopped. callback will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final fn's callback. Invoked with (err, [results]); See: async.whilst &lt;static&gt; waterfall(tasks [, callback]) Runs the tasks array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in the array. However, if any of the tasks pass an error to their own callback, the next function is not executed, and the main callback is immediately called with the error. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tasks Array An array of functions to run, each function is passed a callback(err, result1, result2, ...) it must call on completion. The first argument is an error (which can be null) and any further arguments will be passed as arguments in order to the next task. callback function &lt;optional&gt; An optional callback to run once all the functions have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task's callback. Invoked with (err, [results]). Returns: undefined Example async.waterfall([ function(callback) { callback(null, 'one', 'two'); }, function(arg1, arg2, callback) { // arg1 now equals 'one' and arg2 now equals 'two' callback(null, 'three'); }, function(arg1, callback) { // arg1 now equals 'three' callback(null, 'done'); } ], function (err, result) { // result now equals 'done' }); // Or, with named functions: async.waterfall([ myFirstFunction, mySecondFunction, myLastFunction, ], function (err, result) { // result now equals 'done' }); function myFirstFunction(callback) { callback(null, 'one', 'two'); } function mySecondFunction(arg1, arg2, callback) { // arg1 now equals 'one' and arg2 now equals 'two' callback(null, 'three'); } function myLastFunction(arg1, callback) { // arg1 now equals 'three' callback(null, 'done'); } &lt;static&gt; whilst(test, iteratee [, callback]) Repeatedly call fn, while test returns true. Calls callback when stopped, or an error occurs. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description test function synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn.
